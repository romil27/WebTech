            <p><img src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6D1aOb90/s1200/wet-weather-1.webp" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px;" alt="Max Verstappen at the Belgian Grand Prix, 2021."  width="600" ></p>
            <p class="text" style="text-align: justify;">
                Welcome to Formula Top Three. Formula 1 consists of 10 teams, battling it out with cars that independently designed, with every single component being hand-made and custom designed for each of the 10 teams. It is the world's most competitive single seat motorsport racing competition. In a normal formula 1 season, 10 teams with 2 drivers each compete for the championship. Here, we will only discuss the top 3 teams.Currently, they are Mercedes, Red Bull Racing, and McLaren. A Formula 1 season consists of 2 championships: The drivers' championship, for drivers to become world champions, and the Constructors Championship, for the Teams to win the championships. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Formula 1 championship has been held every single year since 1950. Since then, the car designs, and racing has come a long way. In the United States, Formula 1 isn't as popular some other championships like NASCAR or Indycar. However, what people fail to realize is the role Formula 1 has played since its inception. It is the absolute and undefeated pinnacle of racing in the motorsport world. Thus, most innovations in commerical vehicles that we see today, were originally developed by Formula 1 teams for their race cars. Perhaps the most profound example, is the use of <span style="font-style: italic;">Downforce.</span> Downforce, or forming an area of low pressure below a car, to increase grip and stability is now widely known and utilized to some extent in all commerical vehicles, but the idea emerged in Formula 1, and F1 cars were the first to be able to utilize this.  </p>
                
                <p style="padding-right: 625px;">
                    A fun fact about downforce is that a Formula 1 car produces so much of it, that when driving above 110 mph, you can drive a formula 1 car upside down!
            </p>
            <p>
                On the right, you can see Formula 1 cars travelling at over 200mph down the famous Eau Rouge Chicane at the Spa-Francorchamps Circuit in Belgium on an especially heavy rainy day.

        <h1>Review of the Last Race</h1>
        <p>
            <img src="https://www.formula1.com/content/dam/fom-website/sutton/2020/Turkey/Sunday/1285764050.jpg" style="float: right; padding-left: 20px;" width="600" alt="Turkish GP 2021">
            <!--Image Source: https://www.formula1.com/content/dam/fom-website/sutton/2020/Turkey/Sunday/1285764050.jpg-->
            The last race was the Turkish Grand Prix held from 8th October to 10th October 2021. Held at the Istanbul Park, emotions were high after a wet race was predicted. Fans did not want a repeat of the Belgian Grand Prix, with the race being suspended after just a few laps. Excitement was also raised after it was announced that Lewis Hamilton, the championship contender, and current leader of the championship will be taking a penalty and starting the race from 11th position. This meant that Max Vertappen, the current championship rival and challenger would have his opportunity to regain the lead in the championship. 
        </p>

        <p>
            During the Race, Sergio Perez, the second Red Bull Driver showed his impressive skill by holding off Lewis Hamilton as he charged through the field in an attempt to retake the lead of the race. After being off his game for the last couple of Races, Sergio showed off why he's at Red Bull and defended meticulously to secure a podium for himself and his teammate Max. This secured Max's #1 spot in the standings after this race. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After Valtteri's announcement that he will be leaving Mercedes after this season, he went on to take his first win of this season, after a late race charge. Proving to everyone why he's still called the "Flying Finn", he proved his true race pace after having somewhat of an off season. For sure George Russell, the driver replacing him next season will be stepping into some big shoes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, tensions were high, and the rains only made the race more exciting than what was expected. All the drivers got to show off their wet racing skills, with strategies changing mid race. Lewis Hamilton opted to stay out and continue the race, whereas Max chose to pit and change tires. This move ultimately ended up costing Lewis the potential win at this race. Strategies played an even more important role in this race than they usually do, and Lewis will surely remember the importance of strategy going forward to the last 6 races of the season.
