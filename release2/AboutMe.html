                I'm Romil Agarwal and I'm currently a junior at Babson College. I'm from Mumbai, India, and I'm developing this website as part of my Web Technologies course at Babson. I've been a Formula 1 fan for quite some time now, and I always thought about having my own page where I could write whatever I was feeling about the races. I think this website is an outlet for me to share my opinoins on the races, and how the top 6 drivers are currently performing. 
            </p>
            <p>
              At Babson, I plan on concentrating in Finance and Economics. After graduating, I plan to join my family business back home in Mumbai. I believe studying at Babson has been an enriching experience for me, and it will allow me to join my family business and give valuable contributions to grow and expand it.

                In terms of Formula 1, my favourite drivers are Max Verstappen, and Daniel Ricciardo, both for different reasons. Max Verstappen is the embodiment of dedication and hardwork. Even off track, you will always see him training, working out, or doing something productive to better his racing. On the other hand, we have Daniel Ricciardo, who is the embodiment of enjoyment. Apart from racing, he's known as Formula 1's own "joker", as you can always finding him laughing and goofing around both on and off track. If you want to have a good time, Daniel Ricciardo is your man. These two drivers showcase two different aspects of life, and two different ways to live life. I feel like we can learn something from the both of them.
