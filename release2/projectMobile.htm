            document.getElementById("pa").innerHTML="The Mexico GP was certainly one of the most vibrant races of the season. It was also one of the most important races for Red Bull Racing’s Sergio Perez, as it happened to be his Home Race. I’m sure he has been waiting all year for his home race in a competitive car to truly show what he’s got. Now that he is in a championship contending car, he had the right opportunity after years to give his home country the race they always deserved to get. He started the race from P4, after a solid performance for Saturday’s Qualifying Session, and he certainly did not let his hard work and efforts on Saturday go to waste."
            document.getElementById("pb").innerHTML="While he was off his teammate Max Verstappen’s race pace for the entire race, he was still one of the fastest in the race, even closing the gap to Championship Contender Lewis Hamilton throughout. Mind you, it was a blisteringly hot day on the race day, and Sergio Perez’s drinking tank malfunctioned right at the start of the race. It is well known that during the course of the race, a driver can lose up to 4-5 Kilograms (roughly 10 lbs) of weight despite hydrating. Sergio Perez did not have this luxury, and still managed to finish P3 on the podium, beating and outdriving everyone but our 2 championship contenders. According to him, he started feeling dizzy right around lap 30, but continued to push. This affected his race pace, but not his podium finish."
            document.getElementById("pc").innerHTML="On the other side of the Red Bull Garage we had Max Verstappen, the race winner. He went on in this race to extend his championship lead. Max didn’t do as well as he would have liked and started his race from P3. Ideally, the championship contender would have liked to start from pole position, but he just did not have the pace on Saturday. However, he made it up for it with a blisteringly fast race pace in the first stint leaving his championship rival Lewis Hamilton in the dust. While he did lose time to Lewis Hamilton in the second half of the race, he had built up enough of a gap to come out ahead and as the winner."
            document.getElementById("pd").innerHTML="The race did not go that well for Lewis Hamilton clearly, as he wasn’t able to get the win despite starting from pole position. His race start was poor, and he lost his lead to Max Verstappen in the first corner itself, as Max went around the outside of Hamilton to take the lead and make it stick from the beginning till the end. Despite having significantly better race pace in the second stint, he was not able to make up for the lost time, and ended up finishing P2 for only 18 points. However, his team strategists were able to nick the fastest lap point from Max Verstappen by pitting Valtteri Bottas for fresh tires at the end, allowing him to take one additional point for the team."

            <h1> Welcome to the World of Formula 1</h1>
            <p style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;"><img id="slideshowimg" src="https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/images/mgl/6D1aOb90/s1200/wet-weather-1.webp" alt="Max Verstappen at the Belgian Grand Prix, 2021."  width="60%" ></p>
            <p class="text" style="text-align: justify;">
                Welcome to Formula Top Three. Formula 1 consists of 10 teams, battling it out with cars that independently designed, with every single component being hand-made and custom designed for each of the 10 teams. It is the world's most competitive single seat motorsport racing competition. In a normal formula 1 season, 10 teams with 2 drivers each compete for the championship. Here, we will only discuss the top 3 teams.Currently, they are Mercedes, Red Bull Racing, and McLaren. A Formula 1 season consists of 2 championships: The drivers' championship, for drivers to become world champions, and the Constructors Championship, for the Teams to win the championships. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Formula 1 championship has been held every single year since 1950. Since then, the car designs, and racing has come a long way. In the United States, Formula 1 isn't as popular some other championships like NASCAR or Indycar. However, what people fail to realize is the role Formula 1 has played since its inception. It is the absolute and undefeated pinnacle of racing in the motorsport world. Thus, most innovations in commerical vehicles that we see today, were originally developed by Formula 1 teams for their race cars. Perhaps the most profound example, is the use of <span style="font-style: italic;">Downforce.</span> Downforce, or forming an area of low pressure below a car, to increase grip and stability is now widely known and utilized to some extent in all commerical vehicles, but the idea emerged in Formula 1, and F1 cars were the first to be able to utilize this.  </p>
                
                <p>
                    A fun fact about downforce is that a Formula 1 car produces so much of it, that when driving above 110 mph, you can drive a formula 1 car upside down!
            </p>
            <p>
                On the right, you can see Formula 1 cars travelling at over 200mph down the famous Eau Rouge Chicane at the Spa-Francorchamps Circuit in Belgium on an especially heavy rainy day.

            The last race was the Turkish Grand Prix held from 8th October to 10th October 2021. Held at the Istanbul Park, emotions were high after a wet race was predicted. Fans did not want a repeat of the Belgian Grand Prix, with the race being suspended after just a few laps. Excitement was also raised after it was announced that Lewis Hamilton, the championship contender, and current leader of the championship will be taking a penalty and starting the race from 11th position. This meant that Max Vertappen, the current championship rival and challenger would have his opportunity to regain the lead in the championship.

            During the Race, Sergio Perez, the second Red Bull Driver showed his impressive skill by holding off Lewis Hamilton as he charged through the field in an attempt to retake the lead of the race. After being off his game for the last couple of Races, Sergio showed off why he's at Red Bull and defended meticulously to secure a podium for himself and his teammate Max. This secured Max's #1 spot in the standings after this race.

            After Valtteri's announcement that he will be leaving Mercedes after this season, he went on to take his first win of this season, after a late race charge. Proving to everyone why he's still called the "Flying Finn", he proved his true race pace after having somewhat of an off season. For sure George Russell, the driver replacing him next season will be stepping into some big shoes.

            Overall, tensions were high, and the rains only made the race more exciting than what was expected. All the drivers got to show off their wet racing skills, with strategies changing mid race. Lewis Hamilton opted to stay out and continue the race, whereas Max chose to pit and change tires. This move ultimately ended up costing Lewis the potential win at this race. Strategies played an even more important role in this race than they usually do, and Lewis will surely remember the importance of strategy going forward to the last 6 races of the season.
